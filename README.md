# BankProject
A simple fullstack WIP implementation of a bank. 

## How to compile
We can compile this program by first running the bank.sql script. This should create the database alongside privileges
for a user admin. Then we can 'npm start' the frontend and 'python(3) run.py' the backend. This should open up a web browser
with the authentication page first.

# BankProject
A simple fullstack WIP implementation of a bank. 

## How to compile
We can compile this program by first running the bank.sql script. This should create the database alongside privileges
for a user admin. Then we can 'npm start' the frontend and 'python(3) run.py' the backend. This should open up a web browser
with the authentication page first. This only runs locally since it is a personal project for me to learn fullstack specifically frontend development.

## Tech Stack 
I've used Postgres for my database. Flask for my backend API request alongside python. HTML, CSS, Javascript and React for my frontend.
